Iâ€™m crushed to hear about the passing of a good friend Hollie Haggans ([@raetoes](https://twitter.com/raetoes)) from [@digitalocean](https://twitter.com/digitalocean). We have so many memories. This was 2018 in NY back in my Female Founders Conference (YC) days. Iâ€™ve never liked to share pics but I will more because life is short. RIP Hollie ðŸ¥º.
