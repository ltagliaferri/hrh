Our sweet angel [@raetoes](https://twitter.com/raetoes), was one of the first non-DO ppl I met in nyc (before she joined!). [@tammyxbryant](https://twitter.com/tammyxbryant) took me to a geekettes meetup. She was so welcoming and kind. I wish I had told her how much of a force I thought she was.

I was just looking at her LI the other day bc she was my dream co-founder. We didn’t deserve her and I’m devastated she’s gone. Rest peacefully
