1/2 IN REMEMBRANCE: a few days ago I lost a colleague and friend in [@raetoes](https://twitter.com/raetoes). Itâ€™s been really hard to describe how myself and the entire [@digitalocean](https://twitter.com/digitalocean) community she built has felt. An incredible human, kind, funny and ambitious. We did so many [#hatch](https://twitter.com/hashtag/hatch?src=hashtag_click) founder + developer events

2/2 we even hosted [#sharkweek](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sharkweek?src=hashtag_click) together and even on my last day there we hosted a [@saastr](https://twitter.com/saastr) meet up and she quickly hustled to get the [#hatch](https://twitter.com/hashtag/hatch?src=hashtag_click) info out to the startup community. We miss you and your bright shining smile and light ðŸ•¯
