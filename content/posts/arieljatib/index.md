Remembering Hollie - I met her & [@Microwavables](https://twitter.com/Microwavables) the same evening. It is a wonderful & vivid memory - all of us realizing we shared Cuban roots. It was the first [#NYCK8s](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NYCK8s?src=hashtag_click) meetup, ever. My admiration, respect & gratitude for her only increased - she was always ready to help. 1/3

At DO, she focused on startups & community. She was tireless, extending efforts well beyond the local NYC community.

She is also a founder at [geekettes.io](https://geekettes.io). 

She was an advocate for so many. Her enthusiasm, energy, support & contagious smile will be missed. 2/3
