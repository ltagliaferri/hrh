![Hollie Rae Haggans](../../images/hollie-haggans.jpg)

Hollie Haggans was a master of community work. To build a robust network requires tenacity, acumen, and emotional intelligence, and Hollie was peerless when it came to using those skills to envision a more inclusive global tech community. 

Hollie was deeply connected throughout tech, from startups to VCs to nonprofits to mega international companies. She had extraordinary insight, always knowing the right person to call in when something needed to be done. More than anything, Hollie made everyone feel like they truly belonged.

Hollie will be deeply missed.
